  * Fixed archive signature search in unpack.c

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Fixed a typo in the translation template.
  * Require adminstrator privileges (LP: #340400).  Thanks Agostino Russo!
  * os.environ is a dictionary, not a callable method.
  * Only uncompress files in the boot directory (LP: #341640).  Thanks Agostino
    Russo!
  * Call the correct bootloader installation method for each version of
    Windows.
  * Use registry.{get,set}_value not the nonexistent
    registry.{get,set}_key.
  * Fix typo where a bcdedit command was accidentally created using
    concatenation.
  * subprocess.Popen takes a list of string arguments.
  * Bcdedit requires absolute paths.
  * There's no need to quote arguments to commands when using Popen.  It
    passes them straight through, so you'll get "Ubuntu Linux" instead of
    Ubuntu Linux.
  * Removed an erroneous closing parentheses in the use_cd check.
  * Ignore any failure in delete_directory as it is just working with temporary
    directories.
